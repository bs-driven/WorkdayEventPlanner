### GOAL

My goal was to create a useable and reilable event scheduler for the working person. A schedule a person could not lose and would be able to keep their information even if the decide to close the page.

With that goal in mind I created that just that a schedule a person can use over and over again if they so choose. my schedule has the current date and time. The hours on the table are color cordinated with hours that have passed yet to come and the cuurent hour.
### Issues

My issues with this endevor so  far were cordinating the colors up with the specifc time. I need to fix the apperence of it but I believe thats more a personal issue rather then technial issue. I did have a issue with using localStorage and I wasn't sure how to go about using the for loop to change the background of each table row.
###

As for what I learned; I might be a bit harder on myself then others. I have plenty I need to fix and address. Like the timezone aspect of the fucntionailty, and for instance I want to add a general background. Change font colors; makes sure I got the spacing right. Go back and see if I used proper syntax in my html doc. I need to go back in and make sure its mobile friendly as well. I guess you can say these are the things I intend to fix in the near furture in order for me to say I"m proud of this project and I know it can make me standout. I'm learnig more and more I just dont know enough.
